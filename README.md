How will you use other tools, like trello or git?

Dealing with surprises

What should you do if somebody feels left outside?
Säg till. 

What should you do if someone gets stuck on their current task?
Säg till i chatten och hoppa in i en kanal

What happens if someone feels another person isn’t doing their fair share?
Omdirigera uppgifter
What happens if someone is not communicating in the manner or frequency agreed upon?
